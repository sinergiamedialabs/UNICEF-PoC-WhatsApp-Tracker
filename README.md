# UNICEF-PoC-WhatsApp-Tracker

This app is used to capture the send and received messages from WhatsApp.
For capturing the received messages we use notification listeners.
 So if the whatsapp notification comes, then only we can capture the received messages.
And also for this we need special notification access permission from the user.
And for capturing the WhatsApp send messages we use keylogger which detect the keyboard triggering from the device.
For this user has to enable the accessibility permission
